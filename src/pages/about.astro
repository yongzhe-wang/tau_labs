			<div class="prose prose-invert max-w-none text-gray-400">
				<p>
					Founded by engineers from the University of Pennsylvania and based in Philadelphia, PA, we started Tau Labs because we saw a gap in the market. While large tech companies were shipping incredible voice-enabled devices, smaller product teams struggled to integrate similar capabilities. The hardware was too complex, the models too large, and the integration too fragile.
				</p>
				<p>
					We believe that conversational AI shouldn't be limited to smart speakers and phones. It belongs in toys, tools, appliances, and robots. We bring the expertise in custom silicon, edge AI, and firmware to make that a reality for teams of all sizes.
