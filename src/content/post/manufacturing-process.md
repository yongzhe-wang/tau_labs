Building a hardware prototype is hard. Manufacturing 10,000 units is exponentially harder. Many AI startups fail not because their algorithms are bad, but because they can't ship hardware reliably.

At Tau Labs, we don't just design boards; we get them built.

## The "Valley of Death" in Hardware

There's a famous gap in hardware development.
- **0-10 units:** 3D printed cases, hand-soldered boards. (Easy)
- **10,000+ units:** Injection molding, automated pick-and-place. (Solved problem)
- **100-1,000 units:** The danger zone. Too small for big factories, too big to do by hand.

## Our Factory-Direct Advantage

We have established deep partnerships with mid-sized factories in Shenzhen and Vietnam that specialize in "high-mix, low-volume" production. This allows us to offer:

1.  **Rapid Tooling:** We use soft tooling for injection molding that costs 1/10th of traditional steel molds, perfect for pilot runs.
2.  **Component Sourcing:** We have direct lines to chip manufacturers (Rockchip, Espressif), securing allocation even during shortages.
3.  **On-Site QA:** Our engineers are on the factory floor during the pilot run (EVT/DVT). We don't just email files; we debug the assembly line.

## Case in Point: The Smart Frame

A client wanted to ship a smart AI art frame. They had a working Raspberry Pi prototype. We redesigned it into a custom carrier board, sourced a specific high-gamut display, and managed the assembly of 500 units for their Kickstarter backers. We delivered on time and 15% under budget.

Don't let manufacturing be your bottleneck. Let us handle the atoms while you focus on the bits.
