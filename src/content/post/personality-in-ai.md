Most voice assistants are boring. You ask for the weather, they give you the temperature. They are tools, not companions. At Tau Labs, we believe the next generation of AI hardware needs **personality**.

## The "One-Eyed Planet" Experiment

We recently collaborated on a project involving a unique form factor: a "One-Eyed Planet" alien character. The goal wasn't just to answer questions, but to build a relationship.

### 1. Visual Emotion
We integrated a 1.28-inch circular LCD screen to serve as the "eye." Instead of static icons, we designed a procedural animation system that generates over 120 distinct expressions.
- **Happy:** The eye widens and "bounces."
- **Thinking:** The pupil darts around.
- **Sleepy:** The eyelid droops slowly.

These visual cues bridge the gap between a cold gadget and a living pet.

### 2. Long-Term Memory (RAG)
A friend remembers your name and what you talked about yesterday. We implemented a local vector database (RAG) on the device.
- *User:* "I don't like broccoli."
- *Device (Next day):* "What's for dinner? Hope it's not broccoli!"

This small feature creates a massive leap in emotional attachment.
