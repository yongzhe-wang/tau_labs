We are thrilled to announce the immediate availability of the **Tau-1 Dev Kit**, the ultimate starting point for building embodied AI products.

After working with dozens of clients on custom boards, we noticed a pattern. Everyone needs the same core capabilities: vision, voice, and local inference. So we built a standard platform to accelerate the industry.

## What's in the Box?

The Tau-1 is a compact (50mm x 25mm) carrier board featuring:

- **Compute:** Espressif ESP32-S3 Dual-Core Xtensa LX7 @ 240MHz
- **AI:** Hardware acceleration for vector instructions, optimized for TensorFlow Lite Micro
- **Memory:** 8MB PSRAM / 16MB Flash
- **Vision:** Camera connector for OV2640/OV5640
- **Audio:** Onboard I2S microphone + Speaker Amp
- **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 5 (LE)

## Software Stack: "TauSDK"

Hardware is useless without software. The Tau-1 comes with **TauSDK**, our optimized ESP-IDF wrapper for rapid AI development.

- **Cloud Integration:** Seamless APIs for GPT-4o, Claude 3.5, and Gemini 1.5.
- **Python Support:** MicroPython support for rapid prototyping.
- **OTA Updates:** Built-in fleet management.

## Who is this for?

- **IoT Developers:** Build smart home devices that actually understand context.
- **Toy Designers:** Prototype your next interactive plushie in days, not months.
- **Makers:** Add voice intelligence to any project with a few lines of code.

The Tau-1 Dev Kit is available for order today. Let's build something intelligent.
